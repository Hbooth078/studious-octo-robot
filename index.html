  <h1>My favorite video games</h1>
   <p>I have five favorite video games; Fortnite, Hogwarts Legacy, Stardew Valley, Aninal Crossing Mario Kart. I used these as a way of relaxing and keeping calm.
     I love playing Fortnite when I need to get out my anger and frustration. The rest games I use to calm down and get me calm enough to sleep. They all have became like a form of therapy.

  <h3>Game descriptions</h3>
  <p>Fortnite is a free-to-play, cross-platform title from Epic Games that fuses fast-paced shooting with real-time building. Players skydive onto a vibrant island, scavenge weapons and resources, and erect walls, ramps, or towers to gain a tactical edge. The goal in its flagship Battle Royale mode is simple: be the last person or squad standing as an ever-shrinking storm closes in.
  Hogwarts Legacy an open-world action RPG set in the 1890s wizarding world where you play a customizable fifth-year student, master spells, explore Hogwarts and its surroundings, and shape the story through your choices. Stardew Valley a farming and life simulation in which you restore a neglected farm, tend crops and animals, mine and fish for resources, and build relationships with the townspeople to revive the community.
  Animal Crossing: New Horizons a relaxed island-life simulator where you gather materials, craft furniture and tools, customize terrain and decor, befriend anthropomorphic villagers, and enjoy real-time seasonal and daily events.
